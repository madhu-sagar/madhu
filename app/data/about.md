#### In brief
My primary job role is donning the hat of a software engineer. Have always loved complex systems and the way they work.I see software engineering as that of playing a really long duration strategy video game that culminates in a beautiful climax. It is just as fun and deep as other complex systems, save for a few nerve-wrecking debugging sessions that seem to go nowhere when it happens.

I am available to consult on interesting projects. I am particularly interested in social impact, education domains.
